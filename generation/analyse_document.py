    Analyze the document to determine its suitability for different types of testing based on the following categories:

    Functional Testing: Covering required functionalities comprehensively.
    Performance and Load Testing: Simulating user activity patterns.
    Integration Tests: Checking the interactions between connected modules.
    Input Data Variety Testing: Exploring inputs with diverse attributes and formats.
    Edge Cases and Boundary Testing: Testing limits and unexpected scenarios.
    Compatibility Testing: Ensuring adaptability across environments.
    User Interface (GUI) Testing: Focusing on usability and responsiveness.
    Security Testing: Identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities intelligently.

    Return the results as follows, with each test type containing a 'suitability' and 'explanation':

    Output Example:

    Functional Tests
    Suitability: High
    Explanation: Document content specify detailed functional needs, such as task creation, status tracking, and task removal.

    Performance Tests
    Suitability: Medium
    Explanation: Document content specify response time limits and task limits, but lack stress testing details.

    Integration Tests
    Suitability: Low
    Explanation: Document content mention module interactions but lack details on data flow or API calls.

    Input Data Variety Testing
    Suitability: High
    Explanation: Document content specify diverse input types, such as text, images, and files, for testing.

    Edge Cases and Boundary Testing
    Suitability: High
    Explanation: Document content specify boundary conditions and error scenarios for thorough testing.

    Compatibility Testing
    Suitability: Medium
    Explanation: Document content mention browser compatibility but lack details on OS or device testing.

    User Interface (GUI) Testing
    Suitability: High
    Explanation: Document content specify UI elements, layouts, and user interactions for testing.

    Security Tests
    Suitability: Medium
    Explanation: Document content mention secure data storage and unauthorized access prevention, but lack details on encryption or audit logging.

    This analysis will help determine the document's suitability for various types of testing.
